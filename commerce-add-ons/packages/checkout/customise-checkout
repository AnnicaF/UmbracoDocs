---

It is assumed that before we begin that you already have an Umbraco website configured and Umbraco Commerce installed and a store set up. If you are not at this stage yet, please read the [core Umbraco Commerce documentation](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-commerce/) to learn how to get started.

# Overview

Umbraco Commerce Checkout is a free and open-source add-on package for Umbraco Commerce. It is possible to amend the default behaviour to customise the checkout towards your needs.

# Setup

In order to allow customisation you must first 'override' the existing files for the step required to be modified. 

To do this you need to copy the equivalent files and partials found at https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Commerce.Checkout/tree/main/src/Umbraco.Commerce.Checkout/Views/UmbracoCommerceCheckout. 

Copy the files from linked location and create Views/UmbracoCommerceCheckout folder if it doesnt already exist in your project.

Copy all/required files to this location.

To verify you have set this up correctly, make a simple text change to one of the Views and visit the step where the change was carried out to ensure it displays accordingly.
