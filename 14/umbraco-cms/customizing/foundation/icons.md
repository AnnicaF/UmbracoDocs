# Icons

The icons from the Umbraco backoffice are based on [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/). The syntax for getting the icons starts with`icon-`. You can find the list of all icons in the [Icon registry list on GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/tree/main/src/Umbraco.Web.UI.Client/src/packages/core/icon-registry/icons).
