# Migrate from V1 to V2

todo todo todo

## What has changed?
We wanted to improve on the original flow based on all the feedback received from users of the feature.
Here are some of the highlights:
- New endpoints
- Target environment must be supplied on get-diff and deploy steps
- More options when deploying
- Rewritten scripts to target new endpoints

## Move directly from V1 to V2 scripts
This assumes you have only changes the parameters mentioned in the original guide
