## Hostname Monitoring
Hostname Monitoring is now available on Umbraco Cloud, giving you better visibility and control over your environment setup.

This new feature automatically pings your hostnames from one of our supported regions, and verify the response is as expected.
If a hostname does not respond as expected, you will see it directly in the Cloud Portal.
