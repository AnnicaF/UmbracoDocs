## Flexible Environments for Umbraco Cloud  (Open Beta)

In order for you to be able to work on larger features and still continue to push your code and content through to the regular flow of environments,
we are introducing Feature Environment for your project – now available as an open beta on Standard and Professional plans.

The Feature Environment is a vertical environment connected to your development environment.
It allows you to pull code and content from the development environment and work in isolation on larger features.

❗️ During the beta period, the project must be billed via credits or invoice in order to use the feature.
