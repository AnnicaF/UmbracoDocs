# Docs Strategy incl. notes

## Docs strategy

### Stage 1: Preparation for Public beta (April 11th)

* [ ] Write a new article explaining the concept and how it works, including limitations.

### Stage 2: Public beta starts

* [ ] Publish new Flexible environments article
* [ ] Consider whether the article should be _hidden_.

### Stage 3: Preparations for the official launch (TBD)

* [ ] All references to Dev, Stage, and Live environments are replaced.
* [ ] All articles that mention environments and deployments are revised and rewritten if necessary.
* [ ] Content from the Flexible Environments (beta) articles is split into:
  * [ ] Feature article containing information and high-overview.
  * [ ] Guide(s) containing steps and how to use the new feature.

### State 4: Official launch of the feature

* [ ] Publish the changes made in Stage 3.

## List of articles that need to be changed/updated/removed:

This list does not include all articles that reference environments. This list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14pMRjz2QGPU8o5C1iHbha2DtM9tUdxEq/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=111948135078114796259\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

## Troubleshooting

If we can avoid it, let's not for a NEW feature, publish docs that include a troubleshooting section. This sends the wrong message.
