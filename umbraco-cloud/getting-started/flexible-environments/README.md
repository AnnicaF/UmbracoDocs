# Flexible Environments (beta)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Beta feature: Some features might not be fully available.
{% endhint %}

Flexible Environments allow users to create and manage an unlimited number of environments. This enhancement provides greater flexibility in orchestrating both code and content workflows, empowering developers and content editors to work in a way that best suits their needs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Current limitations

* Only one flexible environment is available.
* Flexible environments are only available to Projects paid with Invoices or Credits.
* CI/CD Pipelines are not supported.
{% endhint %}

With Flexible Environments, teams can create as many environments as needed, allowing for more efficient and tailored workflows.

This feature enables:

* **Parallel development and testing**: Developers can create isolated environments for different features, bug fixes, or client-specific work without impacting the main development branch.
* **Custom workflow orchestration**: Teams can define custom flows of code and content deployment rather than being restricted to a linear left-to-right approach.
* **Easier hotfixes and feature releases**: Urgent fixes can be deployed directly without being blocked by unfinished work in other environments.

Improved Content Management: Content editors can create, test, and validate content changes without depending on the Development environment.

### Key concepts (??)

## Plan/Availability

This should be added on Umbraco.com, and not be part of the documentation. We can always link to Umbraco.com.

We should at least not be adding information about pricing - this is not relevant for documentation.

## How to deploy between your flexible environment and the mainline environment

This is a guide and should contain information about both directions.

## Creating a new mainline/flexible environment

These should eventually replace the other articles we have about creating environments.
