# Flexible Environments (beta)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Beta feature: Some features might not be fully available.
{% endhint %}

Flexible Environments allow users to create and manage an unlimited number of environments. This enhancement provides greater flexibility in orchestrating both code and content workflows, empowering developers and content editors to work in a way that best suits their needs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Current limitations

* Only one flexible environment is available.
* Flexible environments are only available to Projects paid with Invoices or Credits.
* CI/CD Pipelines are not supported.
{% endhint %}

With Flexible Environments, teams can create as many environments as needed, allowing for more efficient and tailored workflows.

This feature enables:

* **Parallel development and testing**: Developers can create isolated environments for different features, bug fixes, or client-specific work without impacting the main development branch.
* **Custom workflow orchestration**: Teams can define custom flows of code and content deployment rather than being restricted to a linear left-to-right approach.
* **Easier hotfixes and feature releases**: Urgent fixes can be deployed directly without being blocked by unfinished work in other environments.

Improved Content Management: Content editors can create, test, and validate content changes without depending on the Development environment.
