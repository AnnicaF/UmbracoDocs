3. Go to **Payment Methods**.
![Payment Methods](../../media/payment_methods_list.png)

4. Click to the payment method that you want to configure. In this example, we'll enable refund for the **Invoicing** payment method.

5. Toggle on **Refund Payments** and **Partially Refund Payments**, if desired.

6. Click **Save**.

Once refunds are enabled, you can issue refunds for a captured order. See the details on how to do that [here](./issue-a-refund.md).
